# Ton Miles Manager for Oil Rigs
A desktop app built in Python Tkinter for the daily calculation of ton-miles accumulated on the drilling line. It is extremely critical to accurately calculate the wear accumulated on the wire rope, with dozens of different parameters involved, because 100's of tons of steel go in and out of the hole at very high speeds and personnel work directly underneath the contraption 24 hours a day. And then slip/cut a section of the line accordingly every few days. If the line snaps the outcome is catastrophic. In my 14 years I did not come across ANY application that is user friendly and has safeguards for human error. 99% of supervisors in the oilfield still use an excel sheet to perform this daily critical task, and then manually enter the results of the calculation in a spreadsheet. My app incorporates all the various parameters involved in daily drilling/tripping operations and has built-in unit conversions which avoid human error that occurs by doing these conversions manually. It auto-saves the day's result in a CSV file.
